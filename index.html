    <p>Our task was to create a sign, chart or something similar using json. Unfortunately, our knowledge was too short to make it according to the requirements, and I did what I could by drawing up a diagram of these sectors alone. Words and percentages are fictional, and just the title chart is much less true that our knowledge without the demo is too short to create a compliant job..</p>
    <p>Things I learn this week was how to instal FLASK, make some funny GIF, understood, what is CORS problem and how to get data from json. Unfortunately I don't understand how to put together all.</p>
    <p>Code lines that is inportant I learn was : pip instal FLASK, pip install -U flask-core. fetch('https://rub36bnpaj.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/test').then(j=>j.json()).then(console.table)  </p>
